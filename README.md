# parables

`parables` is a framework to perform advanced and ergonomic solidity contract testing in Rust.

Note: this project is in _active development_. We track the master version of parity, where things
are still changing rapidly. We will release new versions once parity has settled a bit.

## getting started

See our [user guide](https://primablock.github.io/parables/).
